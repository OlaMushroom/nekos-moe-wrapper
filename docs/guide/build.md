# Build Executable from Source

You can build a CLI executable from source using Bun.
[More details here.](https://bun.sh/docs/bundler/executables)

***Note: Bun v1.1.7 or later is recommended.***

1. Clone the repo and navigate to the project's root directory.
2. Run the following command:
```sh
bun run compile
```
3. An executable (named `nekos`, or `nekos.exe` on Windows) will be built for your platform, located at the project's root directory.
